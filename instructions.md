I want to implement a RAG using LangChain.

Pls follow below tutorial:
https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/

Lets make the implementation very simple and very modular.

The user will be able to upload a PDF file and then ask questions about the content of the PDF file.

The RAG will be able to answer questions about the content of the PDF file.
